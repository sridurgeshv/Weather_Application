# Weather Application Utilizing OpenWeatherMap API
In this project, I have developed a weather application that harnesses the power of the OpenWeatherMap API.It delivers real-time weather information to users.To enhance user engagement, we will incorporate dynamic background videos that correspond to the prevailing weather conditions.

# Load Weather Data & Implement Dynamic Background Video : 
Upon website load or user request, the loadSite() function will fetch weather data based on the user's current location. The getWeather() function will dynamically modify the background video to reflect the API's weather conditions, offering users an immersive visual experience.

# Dynamic Background Video &  Enable Weather Search :
We will implement the setWeatherVideo() function, enabling dynamic background video adjustments using distinct videoName values aligned with various weather conditions. Additionally, users can utilize the searchWeather() function to access weather details for specific locations, updating the displayed information accordingly.

# User-Friendly Weather Presentation :
The displayWeatherDetails() function will present API-derived weather information in a user-friendly format on the webpage. Intuitive design choices and informative displays will empower users to comprehend weather conditions easily.

In summary, our Weather Information Web Application will offer an engaging experience with dynamic background videos and real-time weather updates. Through a user-friendly interface, we aim to provide valuable insights into weather conditions and foster a deeper appreciation for the wonders of nature.
