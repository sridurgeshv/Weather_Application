  <h1>Real-Time Weather Web Application</h1>

  <p>This project showcases a weather application leveraging the capabilities of the OpenWeatherMap API. It delivers up-to-date weather details to users and incorporates dynamic background videos corresponding to the current weather conditions for an enhanced user experience.</p>

  <h2>Fetching Weather Data & Dynamic Background Videos</h2>

  <p>Upon loading the website or user request, the <em>loadSite()</em> function retrieves weather data based on the user's location. The <em>getWeather()</em> function dynamically adjusts the background video to match the weather conditions retrieved from the API, providing users with an immersive visual representation.</p>

  <h2>Dynamic Background Videos & Weather Search Functionality</h2>

  <p>The <em>setWeatherVideo()</em> function facilitates dynamic background video changes by using unique <em>videoName</em> values associated with different weather conditions. Additionally, users can employ the <em>searchWeather()</em> function to access weather details for specific locations, updating the displayed information accordingly.</p>

  <h2>User-Friendly Weather Presentation</h2>

  <p>The <em>displayWeatherDetails()</em> function formats weather information derived from the API into a user-friendly layout on the webpage. Intuitive design elements and informative displays are implemented to assist users in comprehending weather conditions effortlessly.</p>

  <p>In essence, our Weather Information Web Application delivers an engaging experience by integrating dynamic background videos and providing real-time weather updates. With a user-friendly interface, our goal is to offer valuable insights into weather conditions and foster a deeper appreciation for the marvels of nature.</p>
